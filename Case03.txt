For case #3 we will be working with a dataset from a study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Lymphoma is a cancer of the white blood cells which occurs when lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, have abnormal growth.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type among adults & has a high mortality rate.  These data are from a study of Rosenwald et al (2002), which analyzed biopsy samples from 240 patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma & identified 17 genes predictive of survival after chemotherapy.   For each patient, a potentially right censored survival time is available along with 7399 features representing 4128 genes from the Lymphochip cDNA microarray.  Rosenwald et al. (2002) divided the data into 160 training patients & 80 test patients.

The file is a gzipped R data frame with the first column survival time, second censoring status, and then the 7399 gene expression levels.  First 160 rows are the training from Rosenwald et al. & the remaining test.  To read in the data, just type read.table('lymph.fr',sep=',') into R (in case some of you are unfamiliar with reading in .fr files).
