
In case study #1 we will work with human brain connection network data.  This data consists of 114 subjects containing 13 covariates (descriptions below) & their brain connection network W, which is a 68x68x114 array with W[u,v,i] being the number of fibers connecting brain regions u and v for the ith subject..  The data file is “Brain_network.RData”.  In order to visualize the brain networks it’s important to locate each region in 2d or 3d space; see Rpackage qgraph (2d) & the 3d brain net viewer (matlab). 

URSI and INDICATOR identify the different subjects.
